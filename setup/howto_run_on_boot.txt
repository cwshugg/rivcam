To run the dash cam (or any python script) on boot, two things need to be done:
    1)  Adjust bootup settings to auto login
    2)  Add a call to the python script to your .bashrc

Follow these steps to accomplish this:
    1)  a)  In the terminal, type "sudo raspi-config". The Raspberry Pi config will pop up.
        b)  Navigate to Boot Settings > Desktop/CLI
        c)  Select "Console Autologin"
        d)  Exit raspi-config. Rebooting might be a good idea too

    2)  a)  Navigate to the default home directory ("/home/pi")
        b)  Find some way to edit the .bashrc file (I used "sudo vim ./.bashrc")
        c)  Add the call to the python script in the .bashrc file (something like this:)
                "echo Running Dash Cam..."
                "sudo python /home/pi/.../dashcam_run.py" (or whatever the runner .py file is called)
        d)  Save and close the .bashrc file, then reboot to test
