# RIVCam
"Ragtag In-Vehicle Camera" - A dash camera for you car, consisting of a Raspberry Pi 3 B+, LEDs, and Push-buttons - all fitting inside a wooden box from A.C. Moore.

Dash Cameras are extremely useful: they can be used to capture evidence of accidents on the road, proving that it was not you, but the hooligan in front of you, that caused the collision. However, they're pretty expensive.

Behold, a cheap solution to your problem! I'm building this dash cam to address the exact same problem I described above: I would like to have a dash cam, but I don't want to pay too much for it. I'm also doing this as a way to learn about Raspberry Pis and get better at Python.
